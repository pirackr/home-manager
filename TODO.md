# TODOS 
- [ ] common/fonts: How to create default fontconfig (guess /etc/fontconfig/fonts.conf?) with nix/home-manager so that we don't need to depend on systemPackages?
- [ ] emacs/corfu: Don't show no match if no matches?
- [X] emacs/corfu: vi mode save file (:w) need ":w RET RET" 
- [ ] Setup GPG and use it for git? 
- [ ] docker still needs to be system package?
